# Jasonium
A Simple desktop based editor for Rasa NLU / MITIE training model (JSON).
It is designed to work with large dataset by storing all the training data into MongoDB.

Jasonium is developed as a desktop application and not as a web application in order to minimize the need to make network request apart from MongoDB request.
