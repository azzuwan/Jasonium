# Jasonium
A Simple desktop based editor for Rasa NLU / MITIE training model (JSON).
It is designed to work with large dataset by storing all the training data into MongoDB.
Jasonium is developed as a JavaFX desktop application not as a web application in order to avoid unnecessary network request apart from MongoDB.
